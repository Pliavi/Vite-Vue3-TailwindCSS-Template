# Hello Vue 3.0 + Vite + TailwindCSS
#### There is no much to say, Vite simplified a lot of configurations ðŸ˜…

But you can find some in those files:

- **postcss.config.js:** You can check here to install and configure css plugins (here is installed TailwindCSS and Autoprefixer)
- **tailwind.config.js:** Here is the tailwind configurations, check this link to see the options: [TailwindCSS > Customization > Configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration)
- **eslintrc.js:** ESLint configs, that was created using the `eslint --init` command.
